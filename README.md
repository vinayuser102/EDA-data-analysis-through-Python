# EDA data analysis through python
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset 🚢📊
Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal is to analyze the dataset, uncover hidden patterns, and gain insights into survival factors such as gender, age, and ticket class.

Dataset
Name: Titanic Dataset
Source: Available in the Titanic.csv file
Description: Contains passenger details, including survival status, age, ticket class, fare, and more
Objectives
✔ Understand data distribution and missing values
✔ Perform feature analysis using visualization techniques
✔ Identify key survival factors

Libraries Used
pandas - Data manipulation
numpy - Numerical computations
matplotlib & seaborn - Data visualization
Project Structure
📁 data/ - Contains the Titanic dataset (Titanic.csv)
📁 notebooks/ - Jupyter Notebooks for analysis (Titanic_Solution.ipynb)
📁 docs/ - Additional documentation (Titanic Case-study.pdf)
📄 README.md - Project documentation
