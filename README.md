EDA Data Analysis through Python

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects performed using Python. The projects demonstrate various data analysis techniques, visualization methods, and statistical approaches to extract meaningful insights from datasets.

## Contents
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- Feature engineering and selection methods
- Pattern recognition and trend analysis
- Interactive dashboards and reports

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive development environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Pip package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yellowgoku102/EDA-data-analysis-through-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd EDA-data-analysis-through-Python
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore specific analysis projects.
2. Each notebook is self-contained with explanations, code, and visualizations.
3. Datasets used in the analyses are stored in the `data` directory.
